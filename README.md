# Tweets_classifier_NLP

All the notebooks are implemented in GOOGLE COLAB(free cloud service and requires no setup to use specifically used for ML projects.)                

This is a getting started kaggle challenge on NLP[NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/notebooks?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&competitionId=17777)

##### Task content: build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

> We will use various machine learning models to see how accurate they are in classifying disaster tweets.The models explored are:

* Using linear model RidgeClassifier and scikit-learn's CountVectorizer to count the words, and modelling by  EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), Bag of Words, TF IDF, GloVe( global vectors for word representation) and implementing Baseline Model with GloVe(NLP_with_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb)
